      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Nearly one in every six urban Indian residents lives in a slum which means that roughly 17 % of the Indian population resides in urban slums. One observes very few departmental stores in urban slums.</h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-grey">While these stores provide access to many daily required products, more often than not, one observes that the prices are high, the items sold are expired, and the stores do not open regularly. As a result, urban slum dwellers do not have access to many of the products they require. They have to travel long distances to buy essential goods for their survival. Since most of the residents are daily wage laborers, this commute results in a deduction of their working hours, leading to a conclusion in pay and consequently monthly income.</h5>

      <h1><b>What do we offer?</b></h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In trade, barter (derived from baretor) is an exchange system where participants in a transaction directly exchange goods or services for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money. Economists distinguish barter from gift economies in many ways; barter, for example, features immediate reciprocal exchange, not delayed in time. Barter usually takes place on a bilateral basis but may be multilateral (i.e., mediated through a trade exchange). In most developed countries, barter usually only exists parallel to monetary systems to a minimal extent.</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-text-grey"> As a result of the digital age, most residents are familiar with the Internet's primary use and can use the basic English language. This project aims to use the knowledge of operating the Internet to solve the problem of irregular supply. A barter system website will enable residents to exchange required goods within their community without going door to door searching for them. This will ensure that their immediate needs are fulfilled.</h5>
