# Barter-Website-Project
In trade, barter (derived from baretor) is a system of exchange where participants in a transaction directly exchange goods or services
for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money.
Nearly one in every six urban Indian residents lives in a slum which means that roughly 17 % of the Indian population resides in urban slums. One observes very few departmental stores in urban slums. While these stores provide access to a lot of the daily required products, more often than not one observes that the prices are high, the items sold are expired and the stores do not open regularly.
As a result, urban slum dwellers do not have access to a lot of the products that they require.
As a result of the digital age, a majority of the residents are familiar with the basic use of Internet and can use basic English language. This project aims to use the knowledge of operating the Internet as a means to solve the problem of irregular supply. A barter system website will enable residents to exchange required goods within their community without having to go door to door in search for them.
This will ensure that their immediate needs are fulfilled.
A barter system website will serve as means to exchange goods in safest possible manner (as required in the pandemic situation). The website has been designed in HTML and CSS. 
JavaScript has be used for form validation and to create some animation.
